# Server API Instructions

This document describes the changes to the Loop Server API required to become a Firefox Accounts OAuth relier. 

An application can trigger FxA login via Oauth with the following steps:

1) Request an OAuth flow via [GET /authorization](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-oauth-server/blob/master/docs/api.md#get-v1authorization). This opens up a FxA login page.

2) After the user logs in, the FxA login page transfers control back to the relier with a `code` that can be exchanged for an actual Oauth token. The Oauth token can be used access user data. The method for transferring back control depends on the flow. It could be a redirect, postMessage, or via [WebChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/WebChannel.jsm) in Desktop Firefox. All flows require an endpoint on the relier's server to accept the `code` from the client. A more detailed description of this process is [here](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-oauth-server/wiki/oauth-design). The referenced document focuses primarily on the redirect flow for control transfer, but it's still useful for understanding the overall architecture.

The recommended changes to a relier's servers are:

1) **Request FxA Oauth credentials from the FxA team.** This includes a `client_id` (how the relier identifies itself), `client_secret` (shared secret between the relier and Oauth server, primarily for exchanging codes for tokens), `redirect_uri` (an endpoint on the relier's server for accepting control back from FxA after login completes), and a user meaningful `name` and `image_uri` for relier. 

2) **Add an endpoint on the relier's server for the relier's client to get the Oauth params**, including the FxA `GET /authorization` and other endpoints, the relier's `client_id`, the requested Oauth `scope`, and a `state` value. The `scope` specifies the user data the relier is requesting access to. We currently only support the `profile` scope, which gives the relier access to the user's `uid` and `email`. The `state` value is a relier specified value that can be used for a variety of purposes include CSRF protection and flow continuation. We highly recommend using it for CSRF protection by associating a random server generated state with the current client session and checking it as described below.

Vlad's proof of concept creates an additional session abstraction to attach the `state` to (via a session cookie), but it would also be appropriate to associate the `state` with the Loop server's Hawk sessions. 

2) **Add endpoints on the relier's server to accept the transfer of control back from FxA.** For redirect flows, this would be a `GET` endpoint hosted at the `redirect_uri` specified in the provisioning of the FxA credentials in step 1. For non-redirect flows (e.g., from the Loop Desktop client), this could be a `POST` endpoint that accepts the a `code` (generated by the Oauth server as part of the login process) and `state` (hopefully the same value attached to the client session in step 2). The server compares the provided `state` with the `state` asssociated with the client's session. If they match the relier's server can exchange the `code` [for an Oauth token](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-oauth-server/blob/master/docs/api.md#post-v1token). The relier can then use this token to make requests for user data at the [FxA profile server](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-profile-server/blob/master/docs/API.md). 

See here for an example of these changes on the Loop server: https://github.com/mozilla-services/loop-server/pull/98

Here is a demo FxA relier: https://github.com/mozilla/123done/tree/oauth

Below are more detailed suggestions for Loop Server API to support FxA Oauth. 

### Configuration Example
```
  "fxaOauth": {
    "client_id": "dcdb5ae7add825d3",
    "client_secret": "b93ef8a8f3e553a430d7e5b904c6132b2722633af9f03128029201d24a97f2a9",
    "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:5000/fxa-oauth/redirect",
    "oauth_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:9010/v1",
    "content_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:3030",
    "profile_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:1111/v1",
    "scopes": "profile"
  }
```

Note: `client_secret` is kept on the server and not revealed in any browser requests.

### Endpoints

#### GET /fxa-oauth/params
> Fetch OAuth parameters to start the OAuth flow in the browser

Parameters: None

Response Example:
```
$ http POST http://localhost:5000/fxa-oauth/params
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    "action": "signin",
    "client_id": "dcdb5ae7add825d3",
    "content_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:3030",
    "oauth_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:9010/v1",
    "profile_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:1111/v1",
    "scope": "profile",
    "state": "2d37b565fc349d633e57291cf03ac69180f5541bbf06d9de78e373ed43fb62cf"
}
```

Notes:
* `scope` and `action` are optional.
* Set `state` in the server session.

#### POST /fxa-oauth/code

Parameters: `code`, `state`

* Validate the parameters
* Validate the `state` parameter with the server session state. Must match.
* Make a `POST` request to `oauthConf.oauth_uri + '/token'` with:
```
json: {
  code: code,
  client_id: oauthConf.client_id,
  client_secret: oauthConf.client_secret
}
```

Token Request Example:
```
request.post({
        uri: oauthConf.oauth_uri + '/token',
        json: {
          code: code,
          client_id: oauthConf.client_id,
          client_secret: oauthConf.client_secret
        }
```

Response Example:
```
{
  token_type: body.token_type,
  access_token: body.access_token,
  scopes: body.scopes
};
```
